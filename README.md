## About this repo
Though GFL was written in C++98 (on the Wii and Wii U at least), modern C++ features will be used in headers for the sake of keeping code clean and easy to read.

Each GFL revision gets its own folder. The README in each folder will list GFL modules found in the folder at that moment, as well as its decompilation progress.
